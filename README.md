AMP - PyTorch Implementation

Refactorization of the AMP code to better implement machine learning models and optimize performance across high-throughput supercomputers. 

PyTorch is an open-source ML module for Python that provides flexibility and ease in developing, training, and optimizing various ML models (https://pytorch.org). The following package contains a PyTorch implementation of the AMP code that seeks to provide enhanced performance and speed as compared to the traditional code.


Ensure the repository is added to your PYTHONPATH
