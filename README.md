## *AMPtorch*: Atomistic Machine-learning Package - PyTorch

*AMPtorch* is a PyTorch implementation of the [Atomistic Machine-learning Package](https://amp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (AMP) code that seeks to provide users with improved performance and flexibility as compared to the original code. The implementation does so by benefiting from state-of-the-art machine learning methods and techniques to be optimized in conjunction with high-throughput supercomputers. *AMPtorch* is built on top of [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Skorch](https://skorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

This project is being developed at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Chemical Engineering, by Muhammed Shuaibi and Zachary Ulissi, in collaboration with Brown University's Andrew Peterson as part of the Department of Energy's *Bridging the time scale in exascale computing of chemical systems* project.

### Installation

Install dependencies:

1. Ensure conda is up-to-date: ```conda update conda```

2. Create conda environment

### Usage
#### Configs
To train a model using `amptorch`, a set of `configs` must be specified to interact with the trainer. An exhaustive list of all possible flags and their descriptions is provided below:
```
configs = {
  "model": {

      "fp_params": dict,            # Fingerprint parameters, see examples for correct layout
      "cutoff_params": dict,        # Cutoff function - polynomial or cosine,
                                    ## Polynomial - {"cutoff_func": "Polynomial", "gamma": 2.0}

                                                  - {"type": "normalize", "range": (0, 1)}
                                    ## standardization (scales data to mean=0, stdev=1)
                                                  - {"type": "standardize"}

                                    ## A free account is necessary to view and log results
  },
}
```
#### Train model
```
from amptorch import AtomsTrainer

trainer = AtomsTrainer(configs)
trainer.train()
```
#### Load checkpoints
Previously trained models may be loaded as follows:
```
trainer = AtomsTrainer(configs)
trainer.load_checkpoint(path_to_checkpoint_dir)
```
#### Make predictions
```
predictions = trainer.predict(list_of_atoms_objects)
energies = predictions["energy"]
forces = predictions["forces"]
```
#### Construct AMPtorch-ASE calculator
To interface with ASE, an ASE calculator may be constructed as follows:
```
from amptorch import AMPtorch

calc = AMPtorch(trainer)
slab.set_calculator(calc)
energy = slab.get_potential_energy()
forces = slab.get_forces()
```
